<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Tom Marshman.  S3666127@student.rmit.edu.au<br>
I was born in Melbourne and have lived all my life here.  My father’s side is also all Australian but my mother’s parents were born in Morphu, Cyprus.  They moved here in the 50’s.  A few years ago I was lucky enough to travel to Cyprus and see where my grandparents used to live.<br>
I only speak English.<br>
Currently I have an advanced diploma in Accounting and have been working as a bookkeeper in a small accounting firm for 4.5 years.  It a great job.<br>
I am passionate about music.  I play the drums in rock band called Tomorrow’s Sky.  We just released our debut album called Radiant Until Midnight.  We have played gigs at: Old Bar, Bendigo Hotel, Northcote Social Club, Brunswick Hotel, Mr Boogieman Bar amongst others.  Due to the current situation we cannot do this anymore.<br>
I also like Astronomy and reading science fiction novels. I have just finished the Dune expanded universe books and am greatly looking forward to the upcoming movie.  Also video games.<br>
</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>My interest in IT started during high school were I studied a bit of programming and media studies.  It was so fun hanging out in the computer labs learning the basics of programming in VB and fooling around.  We would make simple programs such as random number generator or calculator.<br>
What really sparked my interest in IT in high school was Robocup.  Robocup (not Robocop) is a competition where entrants from competing high schools would build robots out of old school lego Rcsx’s and build robots that played soccer.  An rcx was like this brick with batteries in it and you could connect motors and sensors to it so that the robots you build could play soccer.  The robots had touch sensors, a compass and infrared sensors too.  The ball emmited an infrared light so that the robots could find the ball.  The compass on the robot would tell the robot which goal was which.  The program language was great.  Although you could use NQC, most people chose to use a visual software where there were different icons you could move around and connect with each other which meant that you didn’t have to have any background in programming to play Robocup.<br>
The highlight was going to Brisbane to compete in the National Finals.  As you could imagine this was a pretty fun trip.<br>
Because of Robocup, I decided that I wanted to make robots as a career.  I went to Swinbunre and started to study Robotics and Mechatronics.  I was reading a lot of Asimov at the time and was infatuated with robots and AI.  For our first year project, again we made robots out of lego, but this time programmed with C.<br>
I then decided, I only wanted to work on the “brains” of robots, so I transitioned into Software engineering.  My aim was to study and create artificial intelligence.<br>
This didn’t work out so I decided to study accounting and put all my dreams on hold.  After working as a bookkeeper for 4.5 years I was going to go back to get my degree in accounting.  But working on a client’s xl database made me realise that what I wanted to do was to manipulate and administrate data.  This is the reason I chose to study IT at RMIT.  The idea is to become an Date Base Administrator.  But I can’t decide if I want to major in AI or I Databases.<br>
From bachelor in IT from RMIT I expect to have a basic understanding of how the word of IT works.  Such as programming and databases and web creation.  Like I said I am not sure whether to major in databases or in AI.  I will minor in accounting, as I already have that background and employment.<br>
Also I expect to have lots of fun.  I think programming computers is fund and creative and cant wait to learn more about databases and AI<br>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
    <img src="job.jpg" alt="job">

  
<h2>Research Fellow in Machine Learning for Cyber Security    </h2>
<a href="https://au.indeed.com/Machine-Learning-Research-jobs?vjk=2292f7d385986c7a">https://au.indeed.com/Machine-Learning-Research-jobs?vjk=2292f7d385986c7a</a>
<p>Description of position and what makes this appealing.<br>
I am very interested in artificial intelligence.  I think that the idea that computers can rival or even out compete the human mind is very fascinating.  This can both be good and bad.  There are many science fiction worlds where thinking machines eventually surpass human intelligence.  In many of these worlds, thinking machines turn against humanity and subjugate them, but there are also fictional worlds where humans coexist with machines with peace for mutual gain.<br>
This job is about how machine learning can work with humanity and help solve problems that people would not be able to achieve on their own because only a computer could think in this way.
This job is research position focussed on cyber security.  The title is called “learning the focus of attention to detect distributed coordinated attacks”.  As a first year student I don’t really know what this means.  I suppose it means that the programmes would create bots or ai to learn how to defend networks against cyber security threats.  Cyber security threats could be hackers trying to steal information or malware or people trying to put viruses on a secure system.<br>
Some quotes from the job description are:<br><br>
•	Develop methods that incorporate threat intelligence to provide a temporal focus of attention in the search for emerging network-based attacks;<br>
•	Devise algorithms for dynamically sharing evidence between different networks to provide a spatial focus of attention in the collaborative detection of large-scale distributed attacks;<br>
•	Develop a theory for embedding a focus of attention explicitly in deep representation learning for event clustering and correlation in security analytics.<br><br>
I find this very interesting because cyber security is a whole another word that exists only virtually.  This means it is sort of a world that only exists in the world of imagination.  I find this especially interesting because its an escape from the physical world.<br>
It looks like a job that would be very engaging and interesting.  It would really push your knowledge of machine learning and ai to the limit and would be very rewarding, as this is the forefront of human discovery.<br>
<br>Qualifications and experience required<br>
This is a university post grad research job so you would have to be very highly educated.  To be applicable for this job you would need a PhD in computer science or relevant discipline.  You would need to perform independent research in machine learning and security analytics.  You would need expertise in deep representation learning and other deep learning methods, graph neural networks, anomaly detection and clustering (especially for graphs), attention-based neural networks.<br>
This is not a job for just anyone.  To be able to so highly educated a having a PhD you must be very, very passionate about computers and information technology.  It must be a passion.<br>
It would probably not pay as well as getting a job in a private company, but this research position would be on the forefront of information technology and computer science, which would be very exciting to many people.<br>

<br>Skills qualifications I currently have<br>
I have next to no skills, qualifications or experience for this job.  All I have is a high school education and an advanced diploma of accounting.  If I was to ever be anywhere near this job I would have to be admin or secretary.  I would be the one making coffees or getting lunch or answering phones for the researchers.<br>
Plan of how to get these skills and qualifications<br>
I would have to start at the bottom.  It is funny, as I write this assessment task, it makes me curios to actually pursue a degree in AI at Deakon university.<br>
I would have to earn a degree in either IT, computer science, software engineering or AI.  For learning AI at RMIT it would be most suitable to major stream in AI if that is available.<br>
That would be the first step. After that I would have to earn a post grad degree such as honours in artificial intelligence.  Then I would have to earn a PhD in this field.  That would take many, many years.  Especially seeing is that I am only studying part time.<br>

<h1>Profile</h1>
<h2>Myers Briggs Test
INFJT – Advocate</h2>

<p>Creative, insightful, inspiring and convincing, decisive, determined and passionate, altruistic, sensitive, extremely private, perfectionistic, can burn out easily.<br><br>
Mind: Introverted<br>
It comes as no surprise to me that I am leaning towards very strong introversion.  This isn’t always a bad thing.  It is said that at a party, an extrovert will meet a lot of people and make a lot of friends, but an introvert will only meet a few people but will get to know them a lot  better.  I can say that as an introvert, I function on my own quite well and like to live in my own world.  Of course everyone needs social interaction, but some of us can be ok on our own.  I was once told that when talking to people, I am a great listener and always give thoughtful feedback.<br><br>
Energy: Intuitive<br>
<i>Intuitive people live in the future and are immersed in the world of possibilities. They process information through patterns and impressions. Intuitive people value inspiration and imagination. They gather knowledge by reading between the lines. Their abstract nature attracts them toward deep ideas and concepts.I am intuitive rather than observant.</i><br>
Intuition means that you rely on your own feelings more that hard, observational facts.  This again comes from me living in my own personal world.  Relying on your intuition is great to a degree but it is also important to be observant.<br>
<br>Nature: Feeling<br>
I rely on feeling rather than thinking.  I don’t think this is a good trait as that it is easy to be controlled by you emotions and feelings.  I notice this a lot in myself.  I am ruled by my emotions.  This can be very overwhelming at times and also very draining.  The good side to this is that you can emotionally connect with other people, instead of being cold and detached.<br>
<br>Tactics – judging<br>
Work planning and decision making.  I am very organised.  I like to structure and priorities things and arrange them in an organised way.  My brain is a very structured and organised place.  I try not to be spontaneous but rather organised and prepared for things.<br>
<br>Identity – Turbulent<br>
Where Assertive individuals (their opposite number) tend to be calm, relaxed, and free from worry, Turbulent types are more likely to be self-conscious perfectionists, concerned about their abilities or about how others perceive them.<br>
This sums up me pretty well.  I am always stressed and worried about things.  The slightest bit of pressure stresses me out.  The good side of being turbulent is that you can be more of a perfectionists and you get things done.<br>
</p>
<h2>Learning style test.  </h2>
<p>•	Auditory: 40%<br>
•	Visual: 30%<br>
•	Tactile: 30%<br>
This makes a lot of sense to me as I am a musician.  I am very passionate about music.  I used to go dancing every single weekend before all this happened.  I especially like cover bands.<br>
An auditory leans by hearing and listening.  As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not paying attention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.<br>
Being an auditory learner means sounding out things is more important.  This means listening to what the lecturer says and try not to get distracted about other sounds, such as other students talking or such.<br>

<h2> Suggested careers.  </h2>
<p>Mathematician, software tester, Bioinformatics scientist, data warehouse designer, database designer, economist, database developer, historian, health and safety officer, pharmacist, software analyst.<br>
This test is very accurate.  The whole reason I enrolled in IT at RMIT is because I wanted to be a data base administrator, and that was one of the results that came up.<br>
I am suited for any job that requires rational thinking, logic and investigation.  I find working on investigative projects to be very fun and rewarding.  I like to get in the zone.  This could be programming or database design.  It is good to lose yourself in what you are doing and being absorbed by it.<br>
The sort of career you would never see me in would be social or enterprising sector.  I would not be a manager or chair person, I would not be a social worker or doctor.  Its not that I don’t like people that much, its just a job with a lot of pressure.<br>

<h1>Project Idea </h1>
<p>Overview<br>
Part of a bookkeepers job is to do a bank reconciliation.  This is boring work, it is simple and also very time consuming.  There are better things for a bookkeeper to do.  I propose to develop an intelligent program to do the bank reconciliation, to free up more time for accountants and bookkeepers.<br>
The way this program would work would be to intelligently scan a bank statemtent using OCR – optical character recognition.  The program would read every transaction on the bank account and sort it into debits and credits and then categorise and dissect each transaction, creating a total column each category of transaction.<br>
</p>
<p>Motivation<br>
I have been working for 4.5 years as a bookkeeper in a small accounting firm.  One of my tasks is to do a “Bank rec”.  This is time consuming and boring and there are betting things an accountant or bookkeeper could be doing.  Bank Recs are a basic part of accounting all over the globe.  It is simple data entry.  I believe that there is room for a computer program to do the bank recs and save time for bookkeepers and accountant.  If successful, there could be great demand for this program all over the world.
</p>
<p>Description<br>
I propose a program that can automatically do a bank rec for accountants.<br>
The aim of a bank rec is quite simple.  The input is a client’s bank statement.  The output is a Trial balance for the client, ready to be inserted into the BAS or Tax return.<br>
I will describe the process of a bank reconciliation.  The first step is to obtain the clients relevant bank statements.  The second step is to go through each credit and add it up in a spread sheet.  This is Date, Details, Amount.  This is also done for the debits.  Once each debit and credit has been added up, the bookkeeper will then make sure there has been no recording errors by reconciling the spread sheet totals with the opening and closing balance of the bank account.  If there are errors the bookkeeper must go through each transaction to find where the recording error has been.<br>
If the accounts reconcile, the next step is called dissection out the bank account.<br>
Every single transaction on the spread sheets must be categorised.  This is done by creating columns for each of the recurring transactions.  For example categories of credits would be POS sales, interest earned, bank transfers.  Examples of categories of debits would be: bank fees, merchant fees, insurance, motor vehicle expense, postage, stationary, advertising supplies, materials, repairs and maintenance  When the columns have been written up they are totalled at the bottom of the spreasheet and are ready to be entered into a trial balance.  This is the outcome.<br>

This is how I envisage the compute program doing the bank rec:<br>
First of all the clients bank statements are scanned into a scanner that has OCR (optical character recognition).  This is the hard part.  The computer program will have to know what every single transaction consist of, its amount and whether it is debit or credit.  I don’t know much about AI and machine learning, but I think it could be used here.<br>
The program will use machine learning to know each transaction and the category to put it in.
For instance it will record the date of transaction, the amount (debit or credit) and its category.  Eg:
25/6/2020	Coles express Kew 	$66.6
The program will use machine learning to know that Coles express is Petrol station and that the transaction should be categorised as an expense in Motor Vehicle expenses on the debit spread sheet.<br>
The important thing here is GIGO – garbage in garbage out.  The program must be reliable and must know what category to put each transaction in.<br>
Neural networks might be employed so that the program can find out the category of each transaction.<br>
The output of the program would be a spread sheet with all totals of each category ready to be entered into the trial balance.<br>
</p>
<p>Tools and technologies<br>
The main hardware would be a scanner that can use optical character recognition.<br>
The program would work on a pc and would be connected to the scanner.<br>
The hard part would be finding the technologies for the software to know which category to put each transaction in.  All transactions must be grouped so that there is as few columns as possible.<br>
Not knowing much about AI or neural networks.  I think it may be possible to use these in order for the software to search the internet to find the category for each transaction.<br>
</p>
<p>Skills Required<br>
How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?<br>
An experienced programmer with a basic understating of accounting concepts would be required.  The software would have to used databases to store each transaction in a methodology way.<br>
Database programming would be needed.  There would need to be advanced technical skills employed by a programmer for the machine learning side of the software to word.  Programmed would need to know how to code neural networks so the computer can search the internet to find the right category of each transaction.<br>
</p>
<p>Outcome<br>
If this project is successful there would be a great change in the way that accounting practices all around to world would be do.  The software program would be able to replace the boring work of bookkeepers doing boring bank reconciliations.  In some ways this could place the work of a bookkeeper, making them redundant.
This software would not only help accountants, but it could be used by anybody.  Any person could scan their bank account and a list of all their expenses and income would immediately be created, making it easy for people to track their spending and budget themselves for the future.
